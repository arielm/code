Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between archers
Her very Lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry, but it sounds like a wonderful thing
"I say, Charles, don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?" Ooh, ooh, ooh
And so I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendant of some old queen or other
Oh, has the world changed, or have I changed?
Oh, has the world changed, or have I changed?
As some 9-year-old tough, who peddles drugs
I swear to God, I swear, I never even knew what drugs were
Ooh, oh-oh, ooh
So I broke into the Palace with a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said, "Eh, I know, and you cannot sing"
I said, "That's nothing, you should hear me play the piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you're tied to your Mother's apron
No one talks about castration, ooh, oh-oh, ooh
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty, ooh-ooh
(These are the things that kill me)
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair, ooh
(These are the things that kill me)
All their life, they make love and then pierce through me
Pass the Pub that saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
And the church all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Life is very long when you're lonely
Life is very long when you're lonely
Life is very long when you're lonely
Life is very long when you're lonely
